# webb-extention for google chrome
#This Chrome extension detects the color code of any element on a webpage when you hover over it with your mouse. When hovering, the extension captures the color of the element and displays the RGB color code in a popup window when you click on the extension icon. This allows you to easily identify and view the colors used in different parts of the webpage. The extension uses JavaScript to interact with the webpage's elements and Chrome's extension APIs to communicate between the content script and the popup script.
